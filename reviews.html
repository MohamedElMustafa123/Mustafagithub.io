                        <p>Review from a fighting game beginner: <br><br>

                            I play lots of game from a wide variety of other genres but was never really into fighting games and I've been trying to get myself into it for a while. Tried SF6 and various other games on the PS catalog but nothing really interested me.<br><br>
                            
                            So I took a shot and just bought Tekken 8 without ever having played the series seriously before (played Tekken 5 with family back in the day but was super casual). Eventhough I only have 11 hours so far it definitely feels like the game I've wanted. It was easy enough for me to understand the basics but it's definitely going to take some time to get to a decent level.<br><br>
                            
                            I do think other newcomers like me wouldn't feel too overwhelmed and will definitely be having alot of fun once you go through understanding the basic stuff.<br>
                            
                            (opinion is subject to change in the future)</p>

                        <p>Been a tekken fan since the first one. <br> <br>
                            Graphics have been bumped up immensely compared to 7. The visual effects for me are better than mk1 or street fighter 6. <br> <br>
                            The combat system has been changed significantly with the new heat meter. Able to extend combos or deal more damage when catching opponents with counters. <br><br>
                            The storyline is very satisfying. Has an awkward build up to the final showdown but definitely surpasses heihachi vs kazuya. <br><br>
                            The new characters Reina, Victor and azucena are very refreshing and exciting. <br><br>
                            For me this should be fighting game of the year</p>

                            Great character development and a huge focus on my all time favourite character, Jin Kazama. TEKKEN 8 gets a 5/5 from me.

                            Only nit-picks would be if they refine the heat system better, there's a lot of visual clutter on the screen and online experience can be laggy and inconsistent at times.</p>

                        <p>I give it a 4 star rating. Here is why. While the story is great it's to short and you play as Jin for 90% of it. They needed to make story let you play as all the characters. If mk can do it with mk1 Tekken should have done it with Tekken 8. Plus the story was to short for my liking. It has Tekken ball mode that's nice but no Tekken force or Tekken bowling something many fans of Tekken was hoping to see return in Tekken 8 yet both not there. Some of the new characters are fun I don't care that Anna isn't in the game that's not a big loss for me because they brought back jun to a numbered Tekken game. For those that don't know the last numbered Tekken game jun was in was Tekken 2. The reason is because she died after two but before Tekken 3. She has been in other Tekken games like Tekken tag tournament 1 and 2 but not a mane Tekken game until now. That scores big brownie points for me because she is my favorite Tekken character.  Please update the game add Tekken force and Tekken bowling and for the love of God don't add tifa from ff7 add aerith from ff7 instead.</p>
